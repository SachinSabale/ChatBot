Building of Chatbot using ChatterBot With Python----

Step 1: Create a Chatbot Using Python ChatterBot
In this step, you’ll set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. 
You’ll also create a working command-line chatbot that can reply to you—but it won’t have very interesting replies for you yet.

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install chatterbot and pytz:
PS> python -m venv venv
PS> venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) PS> python -m pip install chatterbot==1.0.4 pytz

Step 2: Begin Training Your Chatbot
In this step, you’ll train your chatbot using ListTrainer to make it a little smarter from the start. You’ll also learn about built-in trainers that come with ChatterBot, including their limitations.

Step 4: Clean data
In this step, you’ll clean the WhatsApp chat export data so that you can use it as input to train your chatbot on an industry-specific topic.

Step 5: Train Your Chatbot on Custom Data and Start Chatting
In this step, you’ll train your chatbot with the WhatsApp conversation data that you cleaned in the previous step. You’ll end up with a chatbot that you’ve trained on industry-specific conversational data, and you’ll be able to chat with the bot—about houseplants!

Step 7: GUI Application Using Tkinter
